# ERP-connect ERP — Complete Product Roadmap
> **Purpose:** This is the authoritative brain document. Every AI agent, developer, or stakeholder should read this file before implementing any feature. Each phase must be fully completed and verified before moving to the next.

## Tech Stack Decision

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **AI Brain** | OpenAI GPT-4o (`openai` SDK) | Best-in-class function calling, TypeScript support |
| **Backend API** | Node.js + Express + TypeScript | Lightweight, fast, already in use |
| **Database** | SQLite (dev) → PostgreSQL (prod) | Zero setup locally, scales to production |
| **Web Dashboard** | Next.js 14 (App Router) | SSR + real-time, best for dashboards |
| **Mobile App** | React Native (Expo) | One codebase for iOS + Android |
| **WhatsApp** | Meta Cloud API (Official) | Required for production; use local UI for demos |
| **Notifications** | Nodemailer (Email) + WhatsApp API | Covers Requirement #1 & #2 reminders |
| **Auth** | NextAuth.js (Role-based: Admin / Employee) | Secure, simple to set up |
| **Hosting** | Vercel (Web) + Railway (API/DB) | Free tier, instant deploys |
