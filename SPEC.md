## 1. System Overview

### 1.1 Architecture

ERP-connect ERP is a **Hybrid Headless Application**:

- **Frontend:** Next.js 16 (App Router) — serves all UI pages via SSR
- **Backend:** Express 5 + TypeScript — runs as `server.ts`, registers all REST API routes
- **Database:** SQLite (local dev) / PostgreSQL via Neon (cloud/production) — auto-detected at startup
- **Process:** A single `npx tsx server.ts` process boots both layers concurrently on **port 3000**

```
Browser -> Port 3000
         |-- /api/*       -> Express (REST API)
         +-- /*           -> Next.js (SSR pages)
```

### 1.2 Supported Environments

| Environment | Database | How to trigger |
|---|---|---|
| **Local Development** | SQLite (`erp.db`) | `DATABASE_URL` not set or set to SQLite path |
| **Cloud / Production** | PostgreSQL (Neon DB) | `DATABASE_URL` or `POSTGRES_URL` set to `postgres://...` |

### 1.3 User Roles

| Role | Description |
|---|---|
| **Admin** | Full access to all modules, member management, attendance approval, leave review, Wi-Fi settings |
| **Employee** | Limited access — own check-in/out, own leave requests, own attendance history |

---

## 2. Authentication & Authorization

**File:** `app/login/page.tsx`, `src/erp-engine.ts`, `app/context/AuthContext.tsx`

### 2.1 Login Flow

- URL: `/login`
- Method: Email + Password authentication
- Backend endpoint: `POST /api/auth/login`
- On success: receives a **JWT token** (7-day expiry) + user object `{ id, name, email, role }`
- Token is stored in **HTTP cookies** (`token`, `user`) for 7 days
- Failed login returns `401 Invalid credentials`

### 2.2 Session Persistence

- `AuthContext` reads the `token` and `user` cookies on every page load
- Session is maintained across page refreshes without re-login
- Logout clears both cookies and redirects to `/login`

### 2.3 Route Protection

- `AuthGuard` component wraps all protected pages (`app/components/AuthGuard.tsx`)
- Unauthenticated users are redirected to `/login`
- Role-restricted UI elements (e.g., Admin Section link) are hidden from non-admin users

### 2.4 API Authorization

- All `/api/*` endpoints require a valid JWT passed as:
  - `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header, OR
  - `token` cookie, OR
  - `token` query parameter / request body (fallback)
- **Public endpoints** (no auth required):
  - `POST /api/auth/login`
  - `GET/POST /api/attendance/wifi-webhook`
  - `GET /api/attendance/wifi-status`
  - `POST /api/attendance/client-ping`
  - `GET /api/attendance/download-script`
  - `GET /api/attendance/active-devices`
  - `GET/POST /api/settings/wifi`
- **Admin-only endpoints:** Member create, update, delete (`POST/PUT/DELETE /api/members/:id`)

### 2.5 Password Management

- Passwords are hashed with **bcryptjs** (10 salt rounds) before storage
- New members are assigned a default password `password123` if none is specified at creation
- Passwords should be changed after first login in production

---

## 3. Navigation & Layout

**File:** `app/components/Sidebar.tsx`, `app/components/Topbar.tsx`, `app/layout.tsx`

### 3.1 Sidebar

A persistent left sidebar displays:

- **Logo:** ERP-connect ERP System (with Zap icon)
- **User Profile Widget:** Avatar (first letter of name), full name, role — shown when logged in
- **Navigation Links (Workspace group):**
  - Daily Tasks -> `/dashboard`
  - HR & Attendance -> `/hr`
  - Accounts -> `/accounts`
  - Credentials -> `/credentials`
  - Meetings -> `/meetings`
  - Tenders -> `/tenders`
  - Admin Section -> `/admin` *(Admin role only)*
  - Roadmap -> *(placeholder, "Soon" badge — not yet built)*
- **Navigation Links (Bot group):**
  - ERP Chat -> `/chat.html` *(legacy WhatsApp chat UI)*
- **Logout Button:** Clears session and redirects to `/login`
- Active route is highlighted with the `.on` CSS class

### 3.2 Topbar

A sticky top header rendered on every module page:

- **Left:** Hamburger menu (mobile), Page title (auto-derived from route or passed as prop)
- **Right:** Notification Bell icon with unread badge count
- **Notification Dropdown:** Polls `/api/notifications?member_id=<id>` every 10 seconds; displays unread messages; clicking marks them as read
- Children passed into `<Topbar>` are rendered between the title and the bell (e.g., the date navigator on the Dashboard)

### 3.3 Responsive Behavior

- **Desktop (>=768px):** Sidebar is always visible; Topbar shows full controls
- **Mobile (<768px):** Sidebar toggles via hamburger; compact date bar appears below Topbar; floating FAB button for adding tasks

---

## 4. Module: Daily Tasks Dashboard

**File:** `app/dashboard/page.tsx`
**API:** `/api/tasks`, `/api/members`
**Route:** `/dashboard`

### 4.1 Purpose

A daily operational task tracker. Each day has its own isolated task list. Admins log activities and assign them to team members. The dashboard supports date navigation to review any past or future date.

### 4.2 Task Data Model

| Field | Type | Values |
|---|---|---|
| `title` | string | Free-text activity name |
| `action_type` | enum | `ASSIGN`, `SMS`, `CALL`, `MAIL`, `MEETING`, `REMINDER` |
| `recipient` | string | Contact name, email, or phone |
| `assigned_to` | integer (FK) | Member ID |
| `status` | enum | `DONE`, `WIP`, `PENDING`, `DUE` |
| `deadline` | datetime | Optional ISO datetime string |
| `task_date` | date | The date this task belongs to (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `is_archived` | 0 / 1 | Soft-delete flag |
| `priority` | enum | `RED`, `ORANGE`, `GREEN` (stored, not yet surfaced in UI) |

### 4.3 Views / Tabs

The Dashboard has three tabs:

#### Tab 1 — Admin View
- Full table with all columns: Action, Activity Name, Recipient, Assignee, Status, Deadline, Delete
- **Desktop:** Traditional table layout; every cell is click-to-edit inline
- **Mobile:** Rich card layout per task; tap any field to edit it
- **Inline Editing:** Clicking any cell opens the appropriate input (text, select, or datetime picker) in-place; saves on blur or Enter
- **Deadline Picker:** Auto-opens the native date/time picker on focus via `showPicker()` API

#### Tab 2 — Team View
- Filterable list of all tasks for the current date
- **Filters:** Assignee (dropdown), Action Type (dropdown), Status (dropdown), Deadline (date input)
- Displays full row data same as Admin View but filtered

#### Tab 3 — Board View
- Kanban-style breakdown grouped by team member
- Shows each member's task count, split by: Done / WIP / Pending
- Only shows members who have at least one task for the selected date
- Includes an "Unassigned" row

### 4.4 Date Navigation

- **Previous / Next Day:** Arrow buttons step one day at a time
- **Date Picker:** Clicking the current date label opens a native `<input type="date">` to jump to any date
- **"Today" Highlight:** The date label turns blue when viewing the current date
- **Desktop:** Date navigator lives in the Topbar right section
- **Mobile:** Date navigator renders as a compact sub-bar directly below the Topbar

### 4.5 Summary Bar

Displayed above the tabs:
- **Done count:** Total tasks with status `DONE`
- **WIP count:** Tasks with status `WIP` or `DUE`
- **Pending count:** Tasks with status `PENDING`

### 4.6 Adding Tasks

**Desktop (Inline Row):**
- A blank editable row at the bottom of the Admin View table
- Select Action Type, enter Activity Name, Recipient, Assignee, Status, Deadline
- Click the "Add" button or press Enter in the Title field to save

**Mobile (Floating Action Button):**
- A pulsing blue `+` FAB in the bottom-right corner
- Tapping opens a bottom sheet modal with the same fields
- Submit via the "Add Task" button inside the sheet

### 4.7 Deleting Tasks

- Trash icon on each row/card triggers a **confirmation modal** with two options:
  - **Archive** — soft-deletes (sets `is_archived = 1`), task disappears from active list but is recoverable
  - **Permanently Delete** — hard delete from database, irreversible

### 4.8 Archived Tasks

- "Archived Tasks" button (Archive icon) in the Topbar opens an Archived Tasks modal
- Lists all archived tasks for the current date
- Each archived task has a **Restore** button that moves it back to active (`is_archived = 0`)

### 4.9 Toast Notifications

Short-lived toast message (2.5s timeout) appears after: task added, archived, restored, deleted, or validation failure.

- Columns: Type, Start Date, End Date, Reason, Status (PENDING / APPROVED / REJECTED)
- Status displayed as a colored badge

#### Submit Leave Request
- "Request Leave" button opens a modal with:
  - Leave Type: Annual / Sick / Casual
  - Start Date, End Date
  - Reason (textarea)
- Submitted leaves start with `PENDING` status

### 5.3 Admin View

#### Full Attendance Log

- **Traffic-light color coding:**
  - Green = Present (has a check-in record)
  - Red = Absent (no record)
  - Yellow = On Approved Leave
  - Grey = Weekend (Friday & Saturday)
- Month navigation: backward / forward arrows
- Hovering/tapping a day shows: check-in time, check-out time, or leave type

#### Export Attendance as Image
- Screenshot button captures the monthly calendar as a PNG image
- Uses `html2canvas` to render the calendar DOM to canvas and triggers browser download

#### Leave Request Management
- Shows all pending leave requests across all employees
- Admin can Approve or Reject each request with a single button click
- Approved/Rejected leaves update the employee's monthly calendar color accordingly

### 5.4 Timezone Handling

- All timestamps stored in UTC in the database
- All display formatting converts to `Asia/Dhaka` (UTC+6) timezone
- `parseTimestamp()` helper ensures consistent UTC parsing for both `Z`-suffixed and bare ISO strings

## 14. Database Schema

Both SQLite and PostgreSQL use the same logical schema. PostgreSQL uses `SERIAL PRIMARY KEY` and `TIMESTAMPTZ`; SQLite uses `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT` and `TEXT` for timestamps.

### `members`
```sql
id            INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
name          TEXT NOT NULL
email         TEXT DEFAULT ''
password_hash TEXT DEFAULT ''
role          TEXT DEFAULT 'Employee'     -- 'Admin' | 'Employee'
avatar_color  TEXT DEFAULT '#4f7eff'
created_at    TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
```

### `attendance`
```sql
id           INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
member_id    INTEGER REFERENCES members(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
phone_number TEXT
action_type  TEXT NOT NULL               -- 'IN' | 'OUT'
timestamp    TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
```

### `tasks`
```sql
id           INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
title        TEXT NOT NULL
description  TEXT DEFAULT ''
action_type  TEXT DEFAULT 'ASSIGN'       -- 'ASSIGN'|'SMS'|'CALL'|'MAIL'|'MEETING'|'REMINDER'
recipient    TEXT DEFAULT ''
deadline     TEXT                        -- ISO datetime string
